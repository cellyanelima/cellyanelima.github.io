            Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
            how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the
            decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
            <br /><em
              >In my last years of work, I served as a coordinator and had to
              make significant decisions to reduce costs. One of these decisions
              involved reducing overtime costs for employees. To achieve this, I
              verified the information that employees reported in their routine
              logs and compared it with the tracking data of the vehicles they
              used. After this verification, I prepared a report to present to
              the immediate supervisor, enabling the appropriate actions to be
              taken. Honesty is a very important value to me, and I believe that
              if everyone acted correctly, we would have fewer conflicts.
              Reflecting on this decision today, I feel satisfied for having
              maintained integrity and transparency throughout the process,
              ensuring that the actions taken were fair and based on accurate
              data.</em

            Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
            your values and identity. <br /><em
              >My Brazilian culture and the people around me have greatly
              influenced the formation of my values and identity. Respect was
              learned through family and community relationships that value
              consideration. Honesty was instilled by the examples of my parents
              and grandparents, who always valued integrity. Love is a central
              pillar, reflected in the importance of family relationships and
              the warmth of daily interactions. Freedom is valued due to
              Brazil's history of fighting for rights and equality. And justice
              is a significant value due to social and economic challenges,
              teaching me the importance of fighting for a fairer and more equal
              world. These values reflect Brazilian culture and the people
              around me, shaping who I am today.</em

            Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
            learning journey. <br /><em
              >My strengths are honesty, gratitude, hope, and curiosity, which
              will greatly support me during my learning journey. Honesty allows
              me to present myself genuinely and take big responsibilitys.
              Gratitude keeps me motivated and positive, helping me appreciate
              the support and opportunities I receive. Hope drives me to set
              ambitious goals and persistently work towards achieving them,
              maintaining resilience through challenges. Curiosity keeps me
              engaged and enthusiastic about learning, constantly exploring and
              discovering new ideas. These strengths collectively empower me to
              navigate my educational journey with integrity, optimism, and a
              passion for growth.</em

            Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
            development. How might these affect your learning journey? <br /><em
              >One of my primary limitations is learning in a language other
              than Portuguese. This challenge may initially slow my progress and
              require additional effort to fully grasp complex concepts.
              However, I am very excited to overcome this obstacle. By
              dedicating time to improving my language skills and seeking
              support when needed, I am confident that I can turn this
              limitation into an opportunity for growth. Embracing this
              challenge will not only enhance my learning journey but also
              broaden my career prospects by making me more adaptable and
              proficient in a global context. Share an example of when you were
              trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance
              or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how
              effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies
              you would try now and why. I once proposed a change in a
              purchasing procedure to make data more visible in the system,
              which initially met with resistance. To address this, I spoke
              individually with each team member, explaining the benefits in
              terms of increased agility and efficiency. Through dialogue and
              patience, I was able to demonstrate the advantages, and
              eventually, everyone accepted the change. This experience taught
              me that effective communication and patience are key to resolving
              conflicts. Reflecting on it now, I realize that involving team
              members in the decision-making process from the start and
              providing training sessions could have further eased the
              transition and reduced resistance.</em
