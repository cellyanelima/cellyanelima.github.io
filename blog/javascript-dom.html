          <h4>
            An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and
            CSS.
          </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              HTML is like the skeleton of the body, providing the basic
              structure.
            </li>
            <li>CSS is like the skin, defining the appearance and style.</li>
            <li>
              JavaScript is like the nervous system and muscles, allowing for
              interactivity and movement.<br />
              <p>
                So, HTML provides structure, CSS dresses and decorates, and
                JavaScript makes the page interactive.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <h4>
            Explain control flow and loops using an example process from
            everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'
            (but not those).
          </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Control Flow: This is the sequence of steps you follow to get
              ready, such as getting out of bed, getting dressed, having
              breakfast, and gathering items.
            </li>
            <li>
              Loops: These are used to repeat actions until a condition is met.
              For instance, checking and packing your bag repeatedly until you
              have all necessary items before leaving for work.
            </li>
            <p>
              In view of this, control flow organizes your routine, while loops
              help ensure you complete tasks like packing thoroughly.<br />
            </p>
            <br />
          </ul>
          <h4>
            Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact
            with it.
          </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The DOM (Document Object Model) is an interface that browsers use to represent and interact with the structure of an HTML. It models the document as a tree of objects, where each node represents a part of the document, such as elements, attributes, and text.<ul>
            <li>Some examples like: Selects Elements: Finds the paragraph and button in the HTML. And Changes Content like: Updates the paragraph's text when the button is clicked.</li>
          </ul><br>
          <h4>
            Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and
            objects.
          </h4>
          <p>Arrays</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Think of Arrays as a List: Imagine a list of items like a shopping list. Each item in the list has a specific position, starting from 0.<ul>
            <li>Access by Position: To get an item, you just say its position in the list. For example, if you want the second item in the list, you look at position 1.</li>
          </ul><img
          src="../img/example-array.png"
          width="600"
          alt="Example array.">
          <p>Objects</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Think of Objects as a Library Catalog: Imagine a library catalog where each book has a specific title and author. Each book entry has a unique name (the title) and details (like the author).</li>
            <li>Access by Name: To find out who wrote a book, you use the book's title to look up its author.</li>
          </ul><img
          src="../img/example-object.png"
          width="500"
          alt="Example objects."></br>
          <p>Tips: >>>> Arrays: Like a list where you access items by their position. >>>>Objects: Like a library catalog where you access details by the name (title).
             >>>> Arrays are used for ordered lists, while objects are great for organizing data with specific names or keys.</p><br>
          <h4>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>A function is a block of code that performs some operation. Think of a function as a recipe for making a dish. Just as a recipe has a set of instructions to follow to create a meal, a function has a set of instructions (code) that performs a specific task. They're helpful because they allow you to reuse code, keep your code organized, and minimize errors.</li>
