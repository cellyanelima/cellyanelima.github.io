            What is emotional intelligence?
            <br /><em
              >Emotional intelligence is the ability to identify and manage
              emotions, both personal and those of others. For example, it is
              the capability of a person to complete their tasks and achieve
              their goals even while feeling sad or anxious throughout a
              workday.</em

            What is the difference between EQ and IQ?<br /><em
              >Emotional Quotient (EQ) is a concept that helps analyze a
              person's ability to manage their own feelings and those of others.
              Intelligence Quotient (IQ) measures cognitive skills, such as
              logical reasoning and problem-solving.</em

            Why is EQ important? <br /><em
              >EQ is important because a person with a high emotional quotient
              can relate better to others, develop greater self-awareness, and
              effectively manage both their negative moods and excessive
              enthusiasm.</em
