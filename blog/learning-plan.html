            A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
            learning. <br /><em>
              One of my strengths is my determination; when I commit to creating
              something, I see it through to completion. Additionally, I am
              honest in all my endeavors. However, I face some limitations:
              English is not my first language, and I tend to be shy.

            A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
            This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself
            to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators
            and industry/community representatives What you will do when things
            are building up and starting to get to you. <br /><em>
              I will be diligent in managing my workload and will communicate
              with the teachers if I find myself accumulating tasks. I will
              strive to be more disciplined, agile, and committed to completing
              the necessary steps. If I begin to feel overwhelmed, I will seek
              assistance and prioritize my tasks to manage my workload
              effectively.</em
