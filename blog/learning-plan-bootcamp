          <h4>My Long-Term Goal and Career Pathway</h4>
            <em>My long-term goal is to become a software developer at a reputable company, where I can build a successful career in the field. Through this course, I hope to acquire both the technical and non-technical skills necessary to contribute effectively to any team I join. I aim to use the skills I am acquiring to develop innovative solutions that have a positive impact both on the company I will work for and on the broader community.</em><br /><br>
          <h4>Strengths and Limitations</h4>
            <em>Strengths: One of my key strengths is my determination; when I commit to creating something, I see it through to completion. I am also honest and dedicated in everything I set out to do, which helps me maintain a strong work ethic. Additionally, my experience in problem-solving and pseudocoding will give me a solid foundation to tackle complex challenges.<br />Limitations: English is not my first language, which sometimes creates a barrier in communication. I also tend to be shy, which can make it difficult to speak up in groups or ask for help when necessary. Throughout the Foundations, I have realized that while my technical skills are improving, these limitations could hinder my ability to fully engage with my peers and facilitators during the Bootcamp.</em><br /><br />
          <h4>Non-Technical Challenges at Bootcamp</h4>
            <em>I anticipate that my biggest non-technical challenge during Bootcamp will be staying on top of the material while managing my time effectively, especially given the intensive nature of the program. Additionally, working in groups and speaking in front of the group may be difficult due to my shyness and the language barrier.</em><br /><br />
          <h4>Human Skills I Want to Develop</h4>
            <em>During my time at Dev Academy, I would like to develop my creativity to better apply it in my daily work. Improving my self-confidence is also a priority, as it will help me face challenges more effectively. Furthermore, I want to enhance my communication skills, particularly in giving and receiving feedback, and improve my teamwork abilities, especially when pairing with others on projects.</em>><br /><br />
          <h4>Expectations from the Bootcamp Team</h4>
            <em>I expect the Bootcamp team to be understanding and patient, especially when I face challenges due to the language barrier or shyness. Support, to me, means having approachable facilitators who are willing to provide guidance and feedback in a constructive manner. I also hope for a collaborative environment where I can learn both from the facilitators and my peers.</em><br/><br/>
          <h4>Expectations of Myself at Bootcamp</h4>
            <em>I am committed to being disciplined, agile, and focused on completing the necessary steps to succeed in this program. I will strive to manage my workload effectively and communicate with facilitators and peers whenever I need assistance. I also commit to stepping out of my comfort zone by participating more actively in group discussions and seeking help in a timely manner.</em><br/><br/>
          <h4>Managing Workload and Seeking Help</h4>
            <em>To manage my workload, I will prioritize tasks and use tools like to-do lists and calendars to keep track of deadlines. If I begin to feel overwhelmed, I will reach out to the facilitators on Discord for guidance. I also have three family members who work in IT, so I wonâ€™t hesitate to seek their support if needed.</em><br/><br/>
