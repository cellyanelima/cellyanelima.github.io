          <h4>Were blocked on a simple problem:</h4>
          <p>
            There was a time when I was trying to solve a simple problem in my
            JavaScript course. I needed to create a function to split a sentence
            into words. I thought it would be easy, but I got stuck trying to
            understand why my code wasn’t working as expected. The problem was
            that I was returning the wrong type of value (an array instead of a
            string). I didn’t realize that I needed to join the words back into
            a sentence after manipulating them. I used several techniques to
            solve the problem: I read the error message, Googled the issue, and
            tested different approaches using console.log to see what was
            happening at each step. I felt frustrated and confused at first, but
            after I figured out what was going on and how to fix it, I felt very
            relieved and proud. I learned that carefully reading error messages
            and understanding exactly what is being asked is crucial. I also
            realized the importance of returning the correct type of value.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Elegantly solved a problem.</h4>
          <p>
            There was a situation where I needed to write a function to find a
            specific object in an array of objects. The challenge was to ensure
            the code was simple and easy to understand while also being
            efficient. The problem was finding the first object in an array that
            had a specific value in one of its properties. I used the .find()
            method in JavaScript, which was perfect for this case. It allowed me
            to locate the object with just one line of code, making the solution
            not only functional but also very elegant. I felt very confident and
            satisfied because I was able to solve the problem in a way that was
            both clear and efficient. I learned that sometimes the simplest
            solution is also the most elegant. Using built-in JavaScript methods
            can make the code cleaner and easier to maintain.

          <h4>
            Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these
            problem-solving techniques/processes:
          </h4>
          <p>
            Pseudocode: I feel confident. It helps me organize my ideas before
            writing the code. <br />
            Trying something: It works well, but it can be frustrating if I
            don’t know what I’m trying to achieve. <br />
            Rubber ducky method: I’m still learning, but I notice that
            explaining the problem out loud can help me see errors. <br />
            Reading error messages: I’m getting better, but sometimes the error
            messages are still confusing.<br />
            Console.log: Very useful for seeing what’s happening in the code. I
            feel quite confident using this. <br />
            Googling: Very useful, but I need to improve how I formulate my
            searches to find answers faster. <br />
            Asking your peers for help: I’m still learning to do this more, but
            it’s very helpful when I’m really stuck. <br />
            Asking coachesfor help: It’s a bit intimidating, but they usually
            have good solutions and explanations. <br />
            Improving your process with reflection: I’m trying to do this more
            because I realize that reflecting helps me improve for next time.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>
            Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what
            made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next
            time?
          </h4>
          <p>
            There was a time when I was stuck on a problem for about 30 minutes,
            but I was reluctant to ask for help because I didn’t want to seem
            like I didn’t know what I was doing. What made me reluctant was the
            fear of seeming less competent or bothering people, but I ended up
            asking my husband, who has been working in IT for years. Next time,
            I would try to remember to ask for help sooner, and that everyone
            has been where I am now.
