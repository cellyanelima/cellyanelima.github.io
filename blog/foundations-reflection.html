            What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?<br />
              <ul>
                <li>
                  I recognized the importance of transparency: I learned that being transparent and sharing my personal experiences is not a sign of weakness, but rather of strength and self-awareness.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I understood how my ego can influence my decisions: I realized that my ego can sometimes lead me to avoid asking for help or not admit when I am wrong. Understanding this taught me to be more open to feedback and to seek continuous growth, even if it means admitting my mistakes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I discovered the importance of emotional balance: I learned that maintaining emotional balance is crucial for success, both in personal and professional life. This involves being aware of my emotions, regulating them in a healthy way, and not letting ego or pride interfere in my interactions and decisions.
                </li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?<br></em>Values, empathy, and self-awareness are fundamental in learning and programming, as they help shape our work ethic, how we collaborate with others, and how we adapt and grow in response to challenges. Values guide our decisions, empathy allows us to understand and effectively collaborate with colleagues and end-users, and self-awareness helps us recognize our strengths and areas for improvement, promoting continuous learning.</em>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning? <br />
            What surprised me the most was the depth of the topic of neuroplasticity. Learning how our brain is capable of adapting and changing with new experiences was fascinating and changed my perception of the potential for personal and professional development.
            
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?<br />
            Talking about myself was one of the most challenging aspects. Opening up to reflect on my own experiences and feelings, and sharing that with others, required self-analysis and courage.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
            <br />I believe it is to get to know ourselves better and to know how to deal with our difficulties. Programming is as much about solving technical problems as it is about human interaction, and developing skills like communication, empathy, and teamwork is crucial to becoming a complete and effective developer.            
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
            <br />
            I believe that studying Human Skills was very advantageous for us, students. These skills are essential for our formation as complete professionals. Additionally, understanding and developing our interpersonal abilities complements technical learning, allowing us to be better communicators, leaders, and collaborators in the workplace.
