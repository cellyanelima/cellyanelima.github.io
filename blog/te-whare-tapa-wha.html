      <h3>Reflection on the Completion of the Wellbeing Plan:</h3>
      <h4>What Was Successfully Achieved:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Taha Whānau (Family Wellbeing): I successfully had breakfast and
          dinner with my family every day. These moments were meaningful for
          strengthening family bonds, creating a sense of connection and
          emotional support essential for my overall wellbeing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing): Praying before sleep provided me
          with peace and a sense of purpose. This practice helped me maintain
          spiritual connection and start each day with more balance and focus.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whenua (Connection to the Land and Environment): I dedicated time to
          enjoy the night sky and admire the view from my house while having
          coffee. These activities allowed me to slow down, connect with my
          surroundings, and cultivate gratitude for the beauty around me.
        </li>
        <br />
      </ul>
      <h4>What Was Not Achieved and Why:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing): I was unable to complete 40 minutes
          on the treadmill due to back pain. Despite my intentions, physical
          discomfort prevented this activity, emphasizing the importance of
          respecting my body’s limits and adapting physical activities to avoid
          discomfort or injuries.
        </li>
        <li>
          Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing): I did not practice
          meditation before classes. While this was an important goal, the lack
          of consistency may have been influenced by a busy morning routine or
          difficulty establishing the habit.
        </li>
        <br />
        <h4>Lessons Learned:</h4>
        <li>
          Adaptation is Essential: In situations like back pain, it’s crucial to
          adjust goals to meet my physical needs without compromising my
          wellbeing. Replacing treadmill sessions with light walks or stretching
          could be a suitable alternative.
        </li>
        <li>
          Planning is Necessary: Meditation requires dedication and planning.
          Setting a specific time and organizing my space to minimize
          distractions could help establish the practice.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Importance of Balance: Completing the family, spiritual, and
          environmental connection activities was valuable for maintaining a
          sense of balance and personal satisfaction, even without fulfilling
          all aspects of the plan.
