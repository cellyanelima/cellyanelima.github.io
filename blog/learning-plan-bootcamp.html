          <h4>My Long-Term Goal and Career Pathway</h4>
          <em
            >My long-term goal is to become a software developer at a reputable
            company, where I can build a successful career in the field. Through
            this course, I hope to acquire both the technical and non-technical
            skills necessary to contribute effectively to any team I join. I aim
            to use the skills I am acquiring to develop innovative solutions
            that have a positive impact both on the company I will work for and
            on the broader community.</em
          ><br /><br />
          <h4>Strengths and Limitations</h4>
          <em
            >Strengths: One of my key strengths is my determination; when I
            commit to creating something, I see it through to completion. I am
            also honest and dedicated in everything I set out to do, which helps
            me maintain a strong work ethic. Additionally, my experience in
            problem-solving and pseudocoding will give me a solid foundation to
            tackle complex challenges.<br />Limitations: English is not my first
            language, which sometimes creates a barrier in communication. I also
            tend to be shy, which can make it difficult to speak up in groups or
            ask for help when necessary. Throughout the Foundations, I have
            realized that while my technical skills are improving, these
            limitations could hinder my ability to fully engage with my peers
            and facilitators during the Bootcamp.</em
          ><br /><br />
          <h4>Non-Technical Challenges at Bootcamp</h4>
          <em
            >I anticipate that my biggest non-technical challenge during
            Bootcamp will be staying on top of the material while managing my
            time effectively, especially given the intensive nature of the
            program. Additionally, working in groups and speaking in front of
            the group may be difficult due to my shyness and the language
            barrier.</em
          ><br /><br />
          <h4>Human Skills I Want to Develop</h4>
          <em
            >During my time at Dev Academy, I would like to develop my
            creativity to better apply it in my daily work. Improving my
            self-confidence is also a priority, as it will help me face
            challenges more effectively. Furthermore, I want to enhance my
            communication skills, particularly in giving and receiving feedback,
            and improve my teamwork abilities, especially when pairing with
            others on projects.</em
          ><br /><br />
          <h4>Expectations from the Bootcamp Team</h4>
          <em
            >I expect the Bootcamp team to be understanding and patient,
            especially when I face challenges due to the language barrier or
            shyness. Support, to me, means having approachable facilitators who
            are willing to provide guidance and feedback in a constructive
            manner. I also hope for a collaborative environment where I can
            learn both from the facilitators and my peers.</em
          ><br /><br />
          <h4>Expectations of Myself at Bootcamp</h4>
          <em
            >I am committed to being disciplined, agile, and focused on
            completing the necessary steps to succeed in this program. I will
            strive to manage my workload effectively and communicate with
            facilitators and peers whenever I need assistance. I also commit to
            stepping out of my comfort zone by participating more actively in
            group discussions and seeking help in a timely manner.</em
          ><br /><br />
          <h4>Managing Workload and Seeking Help</h4>
          <em
            >To manage my workload, I will prioritize tasks and use tools like
            to-do lists and calendars to keep track of deadlines. If I begin to
            feel overwhelmed, I will reach out to the facilitators on Discord
            for guidance. I also have three family members who work in IT, so I
            won’t hesitate to seek their support if needed.</em

            <h3>Reflection on Learning and Wellbeing Plan</h3>
            <h4>Following My Learning Plan</h4>
            <em
            >Throughout the bootcamp, my learning blog and wellbeing plan were essential tools for maintaining focus and measuring progress. I frequently revisited these documents, adjusting goals and strategies to meet emerging challenges and new learnings. This approach enabled me to balance technical development with interpersonal skills, as emphasized in sessions on trust, empathetic listening, and conflict resolution.</em
            ><br /><br />
            <h4>Challenges Faced and How They Were Overcome</h4>
            <em
            >The main challenges I encountered were time management and group communication. Leveraging tools such as calendars for prioritizing tasks proved critical. Additionally, I applied empathetic communication techniques learned in the human skills sessions, such as "looping" and providing specific feedback. These strategies enhanced trust and improved collaboration with peers.</em>
            <br /><br />
            <h4>Impact of the Wellbeing Plan</h4>
            <em
            >Integrating wellbeing practices, such as breathing exercises to reduce stress and practicing self-compassion, expanded my "window of tolerance." Identifying my key needs, such as maintaining mental health and setting clear boundaries, positively impacted both my learning and productivity​.</em>
            <br /><br />
            <h4>Expectations and Outcomes</h4>
            <em
            >My initial expectations about my learning needs and growth areas were accurate. I recognized the need for greater confidence in communicating ideas and seeking help, particularly in a collaborative environment. The lightning talk assignment made me practice appreciative feedback and reinforced my ability to receive and provide criticism respectfully and effectively.</em>
            <br /><br />
            <h4>Discoveries and Surprises</h4>
            <em
            >I discovered that, despite initial language barriers and shyness, I could overcome these challenges through practice and adequate support. I also found that my resilience and dedication to teamwork improved significantly during the program.​​</em>
            <br /><br />
            <h4>Benefits of Implementing the Plan</h4>
            <em
            >The greatest benefit was the clarity provided by the plans. They helped me stay focused on my long-term goals while allowing flexibility to handle unforeseen events. Integrating practices such as weekly goal reviews and adjusting priorities was crucial in maintaining a balance between technical learning and personal wellbeing​.</em>
